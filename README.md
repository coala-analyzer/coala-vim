coala-vim: coala extension for vim/gvim
=======================================

### Note: We are moving away from this plugin. [neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake) is a better alternative with more features.

coala is a simple static code analysis program that is completely modular.

This is a vim/gvim extension for coala.

Simply save your file after loading it and you'll have coala running
automatically and giving you the output in a popup.

State
=====

This plugin is rather young. It is usable but beware of bugs! We'd love to hear
from you, especially if any issues do occur!

Installation
============

Just run

```
cp plugin/* ~/.vim/plugin/
```

and enjoy vim showing you results on save!
